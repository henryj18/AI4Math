# Foundation Models/Datasets for Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science
## Overview
Mathematics & reasoning has always been one of the golden standards to gauge intelligence. In the era of Generative AI, empowering AI systems with mathematics & reasoning capability is becoming an indispensable requirement.

This project aims to collect/curate datasets on mathematics and theoretical computer science, and train/fine-tune open source LLLs to solve problems in areas incuding, but not limited to the following:

- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics
- Odinary Differential Equations
- Partial Differentila Equaitons
- Optimization (linear, nonlinear, convex)
- Numerical analysis
- .........
- Recursion
- Boolean Algebra
- Trees, Graphs
- Searching/sorting algorithms, BFS, DFS, etc.
- Time and space complexity
